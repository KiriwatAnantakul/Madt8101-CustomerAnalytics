2. [Customer Lifetime Value:](https://github.com/KiriwatAnantakul/Madt8101-CustomerAnalytics/blob/main/Customer%20Lifetime%20Value/README.md)

Within this project, we engage in the intricate task of calculating and optimizing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) through the application of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. CLV serves as an invaluable compass in our journey towards a profound comprehension of the enduring worth our customers bring, enabling us to revolutionize our marketing strategies. It's essential to note that our initiative extends beyond the conventional scope by not only redefining the customer loyalty program of the Dusit Thani Group but also introducing a novel paradigm to recalibrate the calculation of CLV. This innovative approach promises to reshape our understanding of customer value and drive strategic decision-making to unprecedented heights.

Churn Scoring represents a vital endeavor in forecasting and mitigating customer churn.

By identifying and flagging these individuals, we empower e-commerce businesses to institute proactive and targeted retention strategies. This project not only safeguards customer relationships but also optimizes business sustainability in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape.
